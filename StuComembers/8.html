<!-- this iframe was an interesting idea.  Its purpose was to allow me to link the buttons above internally to paragraphs below while keeping the buttons above, and
    thereby the names, on the webpage while reading.  This way you could read a students bio from the list without having to scroll all the way down to see it.  But
    this idea was not practical since I could not figure out how to have it search within the iframe.
    helpfful links for learning about this in the future:

        <img class="imagec" src="jwep.png"> Hey there, I’m Alexis. I’m an 8th grader at JW Eater, and grew up in Rantoul! I’m an adventurous individual, enjoying activities such as camping, hiking, etcetera. Social Studies is my strong spot, and seems to also be my favorite subject! I do several sports, but consider them as one whole. I do MMA, however I haven’t been able to compete in MMA because of the pandemic. I’ve competed multiple times in jujitsu though! Personally, I find nature to be my home, enjoying the small details and greenery that the planet has to give! My favorite professional sports consist of either hockey, or American football, with that being said, I think we should mention what I want to be when I am of age? Well, I have dedicated my youth years to a military interest I’ve had for years. My goal is to get accepted in either West Point, or the US Naval Academy. Once I graduate, I plan on either going to the Army, or Marines.
