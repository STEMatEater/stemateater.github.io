                <img class="imagec" src="jwep.png">That's me! Mr. Tener. I am excited about teaching and specifically about teaching this year for a number of reasons.  First, 
                new students come in with+ a passion to learn in an interactive environment.  It is great to see the interest with which students latch onto a piece of information 
                and design something around it.  This gives me a new perspective on solving problems.  I also can’t wait for returning students who want to further their knowledge or 
                learn about and engineer a new solution in STEM.  In short, I am excited about the students, and what they will learn!</p>
