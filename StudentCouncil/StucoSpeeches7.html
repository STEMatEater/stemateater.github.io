<!-- this iframe was an interesting idea.  Its purpose was to allow me to link the buttons above internally to paragraphs below while keeping the buttons above, and
    thereby the names, on the webpage while reading.  This way you could read a students bio from the list without having to scroll all the way down to see it.  But
    this idea was not practical since I could not figure out how to have it search within the iframe.
    helpfful links for learning about this in the future:

My education is very important to me, as I want to do well later on. I mean, you don't have to go to college to be successful, but I would still like to go to college.	Better charismatic skills, getting better at leadership, and fighting for equality!	I will make posters, I will talk about it individually, I will post about it, I will make sure I am heard.	I don't want to be in student council just for the fun of it (although that is partly the reason), I want to make sure kids are feeling safe, having a good time at school, and making sure everyone is being heard. I want people to feel comfortable around here, and right now that's just not it. I want to stop bullying, teasing, sexual harassment, ect. because of race, gender, sexuality, gender identity, ect. I want it all to stop. It might be impossible, but it never hurts to try, right?

To be honest, This might be my first competition that i might ever run for. And because i think this might be my chance to finally share my thoughts	What makes me become a ideal member for Student Council is for what i did for help. I remembered when a student drooped her notes in dismissal time and that's when i decided to help her, my actions were positive, kind, and caring.	What helped me become a good Student Council member was to help my parents. Right now, i'm helping my parents with all the furniture that were moving to a new house.
