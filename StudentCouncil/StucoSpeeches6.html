<!-- this iframe was an interesting idea.  Its purpose was to allow me to link the buttons above internally to paragraphs below while keeping the buttons above, and
    thereby the names, on the webpage while reading.  This way you could read a students bio from the list without having to scroll all the way down to see it.  But
    this idea was not practical since I could not figure out how to have it search within the iframe.
    helpfful links for learning about this in the future:

I also work at my moms job as a volunteer so I personally feel like a very responsible girl. Sometimes I help others around me when they need it. 	Working more, be responsible, taking care of my surroundings. Being respectful/polite to others around me. Working harder and pushing myself to my goal. Cleaning up after myself  completing all my work on time. And also correcting myself when I do something wrong. Helping my friends around me when they need it. Working on my attitude and trying my best!
