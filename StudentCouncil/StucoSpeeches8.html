<!-- this iframe was an interesting idea.  Its purpose was to allow me to link the buttons above internally to paragraphs below while keeping the buttons above, and
    thereby the names, on the webpage while reading.  This way you could read a students bio from the list without having to scroll all the way down to see it.  But
    this idea was not practical since I could not figure out how to have it search within the iframe.
    helpfful links for learning about this in the future:

<p class="paragraph"><a name="Phineas"><b>Phineas Flynn-Fletcher</b></a></br>
    <img class="imagec" src="jwep.png">Hello, My name is Phineas Flynn-Fletcher.  As a 6th Grader I really enjoy building things.  Each day I ask myself what I am going to do and then work hard to accomplish that thing.  I also really enjoy working with others to find a solution.
    I hope to hold several events each month and encourage my fellow students to do well in school. School life is really important since all of the people at school need to work together to accomplish their goals.  Having goals such as getting good grades and making cool things in your spare time is really important as well.  I hope to include everyone in what is going on at school.
    I plan to ask the students around me what we should do and also ask the teachers which ideas they think are best.  It would be a shame to get to the end of the school year and leave things undone.  After asking students and teachers that I know I plan to go to Student Council Meetings and let them know what I think needs to be done.

        He is the step-son of Linda Flynn and the biological son of Lawrence Fletcher. Being a native of England, he speaks with an English accent.

        Isabella has a crush on Phineas; however, she doesn't tell him. 
        She's the leader of Fireside Girls Troop 46231 and often volunteers to help in Big Ideas, usually with her troop being involved."

    <p class="paragraph"><a name="Baljeet"><b>student4</b></a></br>
        <img class="imagec" src="jwep.png">"Baljeet Tjinder is a boy from India who has helped Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher with their Big Ideas.  
        Baljeet is an Indian boy who always gets good grades and is constantly bullied by Buford. He's considered a nerd and, for him, to get an F on a math test is the scariest thing known to man ("One Good Scare Ought to Do It!"). He has moved here from India for his education. He can play various instruments, including the drums and the guitar. 
        Although it seems like all his feelings make him want to do math, he actually just does a lot of math, "the feelings come and go" ("The Baljeatles").

        He is great at math, passive, and very polite. He enjoys trivia (Let's Take a Quiz), learning, and has a compelling need to get good grades
         ("One Good Scare Ought to Do It!", "Tip of the Day", "Unfair Science Fair", "The Baljeatles"). 
         Baljeet is also the leader of a group of science fiction fans, and is the only sixteenth level Space Adventure Trivia Master in the world 
         ("Nerds of a Feather"). He speaks without contractions, perhaps due to his studious background or because English is his second language. 
         He also has an irrational fear of contractions ("Monster from the Id")."

    <p class="paragraph"><a name="Buford"><b>student5</b></a></br>
        <img class="imagec" src="jwep.png">"Buford Van Stomm is a bully in the town of Danville that joins Phineas and Ferb on their adventures. 
        Buford was born in the United States of America to a mother named Biffany.

        As a young boy, he was mostly weak and cowardly, despite stealing the bikes of all the other kids as a toddler
         ("Phineas and Ferb: Summer Belongs to You!"). However, this all changed after he won a pet gold fish at a fair.
          Later, when he was bringing the goldfish home, a large bully confronted him and took the goldfish, intending to eat it alive. 
          Buford was enraged and attacked the bully, managing to save the fish. He was an intimidating bully ever since. ("Voyage to the Bottom of Buford")"

            <img class="imagec" src="jwep.png">"Candace Gertrude Flynn[5] is the 15-year-old sister of Phineas Flynn and the step-sister of Ferb Fletcher. The eldest child of the Flynn-Fletcher household, she spends large portions of her time striving, but never succeeding to get her brothers in trouble for the things they do every day.

            A more successful venture that sometimes clashes with or overrides her need to bust her brothers, is her infatuation with Jeremy Johnson.
             While she isn't doing these, she would often be seen conversing on the phone, or hanging out with Stacy Hirano and less often Jenny Brown,
              where she usually talks about Jeremy or tries to recruit their help in busting her brothers."
