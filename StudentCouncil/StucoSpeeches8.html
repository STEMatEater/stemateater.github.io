<!-- this iframe was an interesting idea.  Its purpose was to allow me to link the buttons above internally to paragraphs below while keeping the buttons above, and
    thereby the names, on the webpage while reading.  This way you could read a students bio from the list without having to scroll all the way down to see it.  But
    this idea was not practical since I could not figure out how to have it search within the iframe.
    helpfful links for learning about this in the future:

    <img class="imagec" src="jwep.png">Hello, my name is Julius Johnson I really like to code and make things fun. When running for student council I ask myself what can I do to make everyone feel safe and enjoy there time at school. Since education is one of the most important things in the world for anyone and everyone I wonder me as a student I wonder what us as a school can achieve of the 3 different grades we have at JW EATER. I want to make sure for everyone that this is the best year ever of all time it would be amazing if everyone pitched in and gave ideas, so you might be asking how well I will go ahead and tell you how I plan on going to every student council meeting and make sure everything that needs to be said will be said and I will try to make sure everyone is happy and do what has to be done	Somethings I want to learn is more leadership, and something I would love to accomplish is to make sure everyone has the best middle school experience ever!	If they are in any of my classes they can write me a note or even right me a email and I will try to respond to everyone and make sure they are also being heard. They can reach out to me at, 14151@rcs.k12.il.us	I wish the best luck to anyone else that is running for student council and I hope you guys have a amazing time at JW Eater!

        <img class="imagec" src="jwep.png">I'd love to be a Student Council member because I am well known among my peers. Personally, I'd like to indulge in a different environment, specifically with team working and applying other's opinions to school events, and etcetera. Furthermore, It would progress my skill of communication.	My main focus is my grades. With that being said, with a positive GPA, alongside my streak of all A's, I am can academically prompt and encourage my fellow students to keep a good grades. Personally, I can rotate and work with people no matter what point of view it is. I'm an accepting individual of all personalities and orientations. Proceeding, my creativity could concoct a slew of unique events for the JW Eater community. 	I am a United States Naval Sea Cadet, which encourages members to be leaders, and follow a think outside of the box, focusing on the operations of the United States Military, or specifically the US Navy, or Marines. Furthermore, I'm great at brainstorming, which has promoted ideas of positive interactions with my peers, and staff at JW Eater.

I hope to learn about others likes and dislikes and how to make life easier	I will personally if you have an opinion I will take time to hear you out because every thought and every idea is important. Because I love being creative but that only comes with ideas I will hear you out on bettering school activities and school 	I get it if you don't want to vote for me because other students will promise you things that are a lot better but if you chose me I will do what i can and make promises that i can keep thank you
